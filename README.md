# 📘 LeetCode Solutions  

Welcome to my **LeetCode Solutions** repository! 🚀  

This repository contains my journey of solving problems on **LeetCode**, focusing on mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. Each solution is crafted with clarity, efficiency, and simplicity to help others learn and improve their problem-solving skills.  

## 🌟 Highlights  
- 📂 Organized by **topic** and **difficulty level** (Easy, Medium, Hard).  
- 📝 Clean, well-commented **Python code** for easy understanding.  
- 🧠 Covers a wide range of DSA concepts like:  
  - Arrays, Strings, and Hashing  
  - Recursion and Backtracking  
  - Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues  
  - Binary Trees, Graphs, and Dynamic Programming  
- ✅ Updated regularly as I progress through my **3-month DSA roadmap**.  

## 🎯 Goals  
- Strengthen problem-solving skills through consistent practice.  
- Help fellow coders understand concepts and logic behind each solution.  

## 📚 How to Use  
- Browse through the folders to explore specific topics or difficulty levels.  
- Learn the approach behind the solutions using the comments and code structure.  

Let’s crack the code together! 💪
